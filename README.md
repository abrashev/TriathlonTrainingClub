TriathlonTrainingClub
=====================

Web application for triathlon athletes who need to train by themselves. The final version of the project is an easy to use, good looking web page with a lot of functionality. All members have access to the system all the times and athletes are notified for new club information regarding their tasks. The most important which make this project worthwhile is the technology that has been used. Most of the functionalities are executed client-side, but some things are processed on the server. The training system is implemented using jQuery libraries, Ajax and basic Javascript have been used very efficiently and are well implemented in the web page as well as the HTML5 language. I used JSON for storing and exchanging session information. The PHP language has been used to execute all commands needed to insert or read some information from the MySQL database.
